            <h3>We look at how to create the 12 most useful graphs and charts in Python.</h3>

            <p><em>Storytelling with Data</em> by
                Cole Nussbaumer Knaflic is a comprehensive book about data visualization in business. 
                It's author has, according to the book's foreword, "worked
                at and with some of the most data-driven organizations on the planet", has taught data
                visualization at Google over several years and now has created her own teaching company.
            </p>

            <p> But one of the first things you learn in the book is that the author relies on only 12
                different types of visualization. The book describes these visuals and their use but
                does not go into implementation.</p>
            <p>The aim of this course is to show how to implement the 12 visuals in
                Python. You can run, and edit, all of the code in the course and download it and the data. 
                The downloadable code may include additional examples not included
                below.</p>
            <p>
                The course is based upon the Medium articles (no paywall):

                <h3>How to use this course</h3>
                <p>
                    Each of the code examples below can be run by hovering over the code window and clicking the
                    green <i>play</i> button. The result of the code will be shown in the box below. Any errors will 
                    also be displayed. You can edit the code and re-run it and clear the ouput with the button.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I in some cases the code in previous windows must be run before the subsequent code.
                    So, if you get an error that says that some variable has not been defined,
                    you probably just need to run the earlier code. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    The code being run here is PyScript. This is a version of Python that runs
                    in a browser. It's mostly just standard Python but there are some differences,
                    for example, to display a Matplotlib chart, you just need to write is name.
                    In a standard Python environment you would need to write <code>plt.show().</code>
                </p>
                
            </div>

            <h2>1. Simple text</h2>
            <p>Sometimes, a graphic isn't necessary,
                or even the best option to communicate data. When only a couple values are to be
                presented, simple text is fine and may even be better than a graph. Let's take an
                example.</p>
            <p>The weather in London, UK, seems to getting hotter in the Summer. The maximum temperature in
                July 2022 was 27.2 degrees Celsius, which is quite hot for the UK. In 2012 it was 24.2
                degrees.</p>
            <p>Let's set up some variables that represent the situation in London that we can use in a number
                of different formats.</p>

            <py-repl id="my-repl" std-out="output" std-err="output">
#Set up variables
years = ['2012','2022']
temps = [24.2,27.2]
caption = f"The maximum temperature in July 2022 was {temps[1]}°C"
caption2 = f"That's {temps[1]-temps[0]}° up from 2012"
print("Done")
            </py-repl>
            <div id="output" class="border border-info p-4 m-4"></div>
            <div id="err-div" class="m-4"></div>
            <button type="button" class="btn btn-secondary m-4" onclick="document.getElementById('output').innerHTML='';
                                document.getElementById('err-div').innerHTML='';">
                Clear Output
            </button>

            <p>Now, look at the bar graph, below - it shows a temperature change from one year to another.
                And while it's clear that the temperature went up a few degrees, you can't clearly see
                exactly how much or precisely what those temperatures are.</p>
            <p><img width="50%"
                    src="https://github.com/alanjones2/12Visuals/raw/main/images/1-bar.png">
            </p>
            <p>So, let's see how some text only visuals can give us a better idea of what is going on.</p>
 
            <p> The code below is a Mathplotlib chart but with no figure plotted in it - we simply
                position text in the right places using <code>ax.text()</code>, where the first two parameters are the x/y coordinates.
                We turn of the axes, ticks etc. with the statement
                <code>ax3.axis('off')</code>, so that we end up with just the text.
                
            </p>
            <p>
                Run the code below to see the figure that we have created and feel free to change some of the 
                code to achieve a different effect (maybe the font size, colors or x/y coordinates). 
            </p>

            <p>This is a bit bolder and more eye-catching than the other one.</p>

            <h2>2. Table</h2>
            <p>A table can be a suitable visual for showing data to a varied audience each of whom are
                interested in a particular row or column.</p>
            <p>Matplotlib doesn't support a standalone table, however, for those using 
            Streamlit there are two methods for displaying tables, <code>st.table()</code> and
                <code>st.dataframe()</code>.
            </p>
            <p>
                If you are using Jupyter Notebooks then just typing the name of a Pandas 
                dataframe will give a good rendition of a table. 
            </p>
            <p>
                PyScript renders a simple version of a table as we can see below. A better 
                version could be created using HTML (we won't go into that here).
            </p>
            <p>Using the same data as above, here is the code for displaying the data as a table in PyScript. </p>
            <py-repl id="my-repl" std-out="output3" std-err="output3">
import pandas as pd
temps = pd.DataFrame()
temps['Year'] = ('2012', '2022')
temps['Temperature'] = (24.2,27.2)
temps

            </py-repl>
            <div id="output3" class="border border-info p-4 m-4"></div>
            <div id="err-div3" class="m-4"></div>
            <button type="button" class="btn btn-secondary m-4" onclick="document.getElementById('output3').innerHTML='';
        document.getElementById('err-div3').innerHTML='';">
                Clear Output
            </button>

            <p>The Streamlit and Jupyter versions are rather better, e.g.</p>

            <div class="row">
                <div class="col-sm-4 p-4 m-4 bg-white">
                    <p><i >Streamlit dataframe:</i> 
                    <img src="https://github.com/alanjones2/12Visuals/raw/main/images/dataframe.png">
                    </p>
                </div>

                <div class="col-sm-4 p-4 m-4 bg-white">
                    <p><i>Jupyter dataframe: </i>
                        <img src="https://github.com/alanjones2/12Visuals/raw/main/images/jupytertable.png">
                    </p>
                </div>
            </div>
            Unfortunately, we cannot run Streamlit or Jupyter, here.

            <h2>3. Heatmap</h2>
            <p>
                A heatmap is a figure that uses colour rather than numbers to highlight value differences in
                a table.
            </p>

            <p>
                The figure below shows the relative global temperatures over the last 150 years or so and is
                taken from my article <a
                    href="https://towardsdatascience.com/topical-plots-global-warming-6b5fb80a0371">Topical
                    Plots: Global Warming Heatmaps
                </a>.
            </p>

            <p>
                One of the easiest ways of creating a heatmap is with the Seaborn library. You can see from
                the code below that Seaborn simply take a Pandas dataframe as a parameter and displays
                the appropiate map as a matplotlib chart.
            </p>

            <py-repl id="my-repl" std-out="output4" std-err="output4">


import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from pyodide.http import open_url

url='https://raw.githubusercontent.com/alanjones2/12Visuals/main/data/tempbydecade.csv'
url_content = open_url(url)

gwdec = pd.read_csv(url_content, delimiter=' ')
gwdec=gwdec.set_index('Year')

        document.getElementById('err-div4').innerHTML='';">
                Clear Output
            </button>

            <p>You can achieve a similar chart using the <code>imshow()</code> function in matplotlib (see
                the downloadable code for an example).</p>

<!--Scatter plot-->
            <h2>4. Scatterplot</h2>
            <p> 
                Scatterplots are used to show the relationship between two variables. The example below uses
                a data file that records weather data for each month in London in 2018. This data set records 
                the maximum, minimum and mean temperatures (<i>Tmax</i>, <i>Tmin</i> and <i>Tmean</i>), the rainfall (<i>Rain</i>) 
                and the number of hours of sunshine (<i>Sun</i>) for each month.  
            </p>
            <p>It looks something like this:
                <img width="80%" alt="" src="https://github.com/alanjones2/12Visuals/raw/main/images/weatherdf.png">
            </p>
            <p>
                The scatter plot
                plots the level of rainfall in millimetres, against the number of hours of sunshine.
                Of course, when it is raining the sun is not normally shining, so you would expect to see
                fewer hours of sunshine when it rains more. You will notice that the scatter diagram clearly shows this
                relationship.</p>
            <p>The code below uses the Matplotlib to create the chart.</p>

            <py-repl id="my-repl" std-out="output5" std-err="err-div5">
            
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from pyodide.http import open_url

url='https://raw.githubusercontent.com/alanjones2/12Visuals/main/data/london2018-2.csv'
url_content = open_url(url)
weather = pd.read_csv(url_content)
fig, ax = plt.subplots()
weather.plot.scatter(x='Rain', y='Sun', ax=ax)
fig

            </py-repl>
            <div id="output5" class="border border-info p-4 m-4"></div>
            <div id="err-div5" class="m-4"></div>
            <button type="button" class="btn btn-secondary m-4" onclick="document.getElementById('output5').innerHTML='';
        document.getElementById('err-div5').innerHTML='';">
                Clear Output
            </button>

            <p>
                When you have run this code, clear the output and try changing the <code>y</code> parameter to 'Tmax' - that 
                will plot rainfall against the mean temperature <code>Tmean</code>, and you will see that, as you would expect,
                the temperature is higher when it is not raining.
            </p>

<!--Line plot-->
            <h2>5. Line</h2>
            <p>Line graphs are used for continuous data and, often, for time series data, too.</p>
            <p>Using the same weather data as above, we are going to look at three different line graphs.
            </p>
            <p>First, we'll plot the mean temperature over the year, then we'll see how we can place
                multiple plots in the same figure by plotting mean, maximum and minimum temperatures.
                Finally, in the third chart we will see how we can show a range of values by plotting
                the mean temperature with shading around it to indicate the range of maximum and minimum
                around that mean - you can use the same technique to show confidence levels.</p>
            <p>First we read in the data. It contains various monthly readings for temperature, hours of
                sunshine and rainfall.</p>
            <p><code>Python
weather =  pd.read_csv('data/london2018.csv')
weather['Tmean'] = (weather['Tmax'] + weather['Tmin'])/2</code></p>
            <p>It looks like this:
                <img width="25%" alt="" src="https://github.com/alanjones2/12Visuals/raw/main/images/weatherdf.png">
            </p>
            <p>It didn't have the <em>mean</em> column originally - we created it on the second line of
                code, above.</p>
            <p>Now, the simple line plot.</p>
            <p><code>Python
fig, ax = plt.subplots()
ax = weather.plot.line(x='Month', y = 'Tmean', ax=ax)
st.pyplot(fig)</code>
                A very straightforward line plot of the mean temperature using Matplotlib.</p>

            </p>
            <p>And creating mulitple plots in the same figure is just a matter of creating new axes for
                those plots.</p>
            <p>```` Python
                ax = weather.plot.line(x='Month', y = 'Tmax', color = 'lightgrey', ax=ax)
                ax = weather.plot.line(x='Month', y = 'Tmin', color = 'lightgrey', ax=ax)</p>
            <p>st.pyplot(fig)
                ````</p>
            <p>The code above adds two more axes for the minimum and maximum temperatures - which I've
                coloured differently to the <em>mean</em> plot - and then replots the figure.</p>
            <p><img width="25%" alt=""
                    src="https://github.com/alanjones2/12Visuals/raw/main/images/lineplotmeanminmax.png">
            </p>
            <p>You can see that this gives us a range that could be more visually appealing if it were
                shaded.</p>
            <p>We do this using the Matplotlib function <code>fill_between()</code> as follows:</p>
            <p>```` Python
                plt.fill_between(weather['Month'],
                weather['Tmax'],
                weather['Tmin'], color='lightgrey', alpha=0.5)</p>
            <p>ax.get_legend().set_visible(False)
                ax.set_ylabel('Temperature Range °C')
                ````</p>
            <p>The fill colour is set to <code>lightgrey</code> so it blends in the the upper and lower
                plots. I've also hidded the legend and given the y axis a label to show what we are
                attempting to represent.</p>
            <p><img width="25%" alt="" src="https://github.com/alanjones2/12Visuals/raw/main/images/lineplotshaded.png">
            </p>
            <p>As you can see this would be a very suitable representation of a confidence levels. You
                could, for example, create the upper and lower plots using a fixed percentage of the
                original one. So, for example, the upper plot line could take the value of the centre
                value plus 5%, and the lower one the centre value minus 5%.</p>
            <h2>6. Slopegraph</h2>
            <p>A Slopegraph is simply a line graph that conforms a particular style but that only compares
                two sets of values.</p>
            <p>According to CNK, "slopegraphs can be useful when you have two time periods or points of
                comparison and want to quickly show relative increases
                and decreases".</p>
            <p>Unfortunately, the slopegraph is not often found in standard visualization libraries, so you
                could simply use a line graph instead and it should convey the same meaning.</p>
            <p>I'll carry on with our weather theme, I'm going to create a couple of graphs that display the
                change in temperature that we saw in the text figure, above, but this time we compare
                London to Wick, in Scotland:</p>
            <p><img width="25%" alt="" src="https://github.com/alanjones2/12Visuals/raw/main/images/slopetable.png">
            </p>
            <p>This data represents the maximum temperature is two cities in two seperate years. In the
                following code we draw two plots in the same figure. The first is a simple line graph of
                the data, then we superimpose a scatter chart with only four points to give us the
                archetypal blobs at the end of the slopegraph lines.</p>
            <p>```` Python
                import streamlit as st
                import pandas as pd
                import matplotlib.pyplot as plt</p>
            <p>st.header("Slope graph")</p>
            <p>st.subheader("Here is the data")
                df = pd.DataFrame()
                df['year']=[2012,2022]
                df['London']=(24.2,27.2)
                df['Wick']=(14.8,17.3)</p>
            <p>st.table(df)</p>
            <p>st.subheader("A Slopegraph as a line graph")
                fig, ax = plt.subplots()</p>
            <p>ax = df.plot(x='year', color = ('red', 'blue'), ax=ax)
                ax = df.plot.scatter(x='year',y='London', color= 'red', ax=ax)
                df.plot.scatter(x='year',y='Wick', color = 'blue', ax=ax)</p>
            <p>plt.xlim(2010,2024)
                plt.xticks(df['year'])
                ax.set_ylabel('')
                st.pyplot(fig)
                ````
                It looks reasonably ok but is not the typical form of a slopechart, certainly not the
                way they are represented in the CNK's book.</p>
            <p><img width="25%" alt="" src="https://github.com/alanjones2/12Visuals/raw/main/images/slopeline.png"></p>
            <p>To make a more conventional slopegraph we need to do a bit of manipulation on the matplotlib
                graph.</p>
            <p>Here's the type of rendering that CNK has in her book:</p>
            <p><img width="25%" alt="" src="https://github.com/alanjones2/12Visuals/raw/main/images/slope.png"></p>
            <p>It's quite different in that the y values, and the legend text, are written at the ends of
                the lines and the conventional axes are removed.</p>
            <p>Running this code will display the graph above.</p>
            <p>```` Python
                ax.text(df.year[0] -5, df.London[0], df.columns[1])
                ax.text(df.year[0] -2.5,df.London[0], f'{df.London[0]}°C')
                ax.text(df.year[1] +1, df.London[1],f'{df.London[1]}°C')
                ax.text(df.year[0] -5, df.Wick[0], df.columns[2])
                ax.text(df.year[0] -2.5, df.Wick[0],f'{df.Wick[0]}°C')
                ax.text(df.year[1] +1, df.Wick[1],f'{df.Wick[1]}°C')</p>
            <p>ax.spines['right'].set_visible(False)
                ax.spines['left'].set_visible(False)
                ax.spines['bottom'].set_visible(False)
                ax.spines['top'].set_visible(False)</p>
            <p>ax.xaxis.grid(visible=True, color = 'black')
                ax.get_yaxis().set_visible(False)</p>
            <p>ax.get_legend().set_visible(False)</p>
            <p>st.pyplot(fig)
                ````
                The first six lines add the text and values to the endo of the lines, then we remove the
                splines (the frame of the chart) and finally we add an x-axis grid (which only consists
                of two lines) and hide the legend.</p>
            <p>Is that too much effort for a not much different result? I'll let you decide.</p>
