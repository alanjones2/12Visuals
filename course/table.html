<h2>2. Tables</h2>
<p>A table can be a suitable visual for showing data to a varied audience each of whom are
    interested in a particular row or column.</p>
<p>Matplotlib doesn't support a standalone table, however, for those using
    Streamlit there are two methods for displaying tables, <code>st.table()</code> and
    <code>st.dataframe()</code>.

<p>
    If you are using Jupyter Notebooks then just typing the name of a Pandas
    dataframe will give a good rendition of a table.
</p>
<div class="row">
    <div class="col">
        <i>Streamlit dataframe:</i>
        <img src="https://github.com/alanjones2/12Visuals/raw/main/images/dataframe.png">
    </div>
    <div class="col">
        <i>Jupyter dataframe: </i>
        <img src="https://github.com/alanjones2/12Visuals/raw/main/images/jupytertable.png">
    </div>
</div>
<p>
    Unfortunately we can't demonstrate either of those options here but, instead, we can use Plotly.
    Most Python environments support Plotly and we can use the Plotly Graphic Objects library to display a table. 
    The Plotly library is quite flexible, we can adjust the way the table looks and its colour scheme, for example. Here are two examples.
    The first is a simple table that uses the default values and the second shows how you can change
    the table's appearance.

<p>
    The data is the same as were used in the <i>Text</i> section. It's just a couple of temperature recorded over two years.
</p>


<py-script>
    utils.codeElement("table1", codefile="./code/plotlytable1.py")
</py-script>
<div id="table1"></div>
<p>
    Here is a slightly more complicated version of the same fugure. Here we adjust the colour scheme using additional
    parameters.
    The code is fairly self-explanatory.
</p>
<py-script>
    utils.codeElement("table2", codefile="./code/plotlytable2.py")
</py-script>
<div id="table2"></div>

<p>
    Tables are very useful (although not terrible exiting), we can now move on to more graphical representations of our
    data.
