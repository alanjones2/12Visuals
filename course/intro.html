                In this course you will learn how to create the 12 most useful charts by running the code in 
                a live interactive Python window. Learn by doing not just watching and reading. You can change 
                the code or write your own and run it live in the browser.

                <p><em>Storytelling with Data</em> by
                Cole Nussbaumer Knaflic is a comprehensive book about data visualization in business. 
                It's author has taught data
                visualization at Google over several years and this book is based on her extensive hands-on exoerience.
                </p>

                <p>One of the first things you learn in the book is that the author relies on only 12
                different types of visualization. The book describes these visuals and their use but
                does not go into implementation.</p>
                <p>That's what we will do here. In this course we will implement the 12 visuals in
                Python and you can run, and edit, all of the code in the course.
                </p>

                <h3>How to use this course</h3>
                <p>
                    Each of the code examples below can be run by hovering over the code window and clicking the
                    green <i>play</i> button. The result of the code will be shown in the box. Any errors will 
                    also be displayed. You can edit the code and re-run it and clear the ouput with the button.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I in some cases the code in previous windows must be run before the subsequent code.
                    So, if you get an error that says that some variable has not been defined,
                    you probably just need to run the earlier code. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    The code being run here is PyScript. This is a version of Python that runs
                    in a browser. It's mostly just standard Python but there are some differences,
                    for example, to display a Matplotlib chart, you just need to write is name.
                    In a standard Python environment you would need to write <code>plt.show().</code>
