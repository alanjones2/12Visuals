            <h2>5. Line</h2>
            <p>Line graphs are used for continuous data and, often, for time series data, too.</p>
            <p>Using the same weather data as above, we are going to look at three different line graphs.
            </p>
            <p>First, we'll plot the mean temperature over the year, then we'll see how we can place
                multiple plots in the same figure by plotting mean, maximum and minimum temperatures.
                Finally, in the third chart we will see how we can show a range of values by plotting
                the mean temperature with shading around it to indicate the range of maximum and minimum
                around that mean - you can use the same technique to show confidence levels.</p>
            <p>First we read in the data. It contains various monthly readings for temperature, hours of
                sunshine and rainfall.</p>

            <p>Now, the simple line plot.</p>
            <py-repl id="my-repl" std-out="output6" std-err="err-div6">
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from pyodide.http import open_url

url='https://raw.githubusercontent.com/alanjones2/12Visuals/main/data/london2018-2.csv'
url_content = open_url(url)
weather = pd.read_csv(url_content)

fig, ax = plt.subplots()
ax = weather.plot.line(x='Month', y = 'Tmean', ax=ax)

            </py-repl>
            <div id="output6" class="border border-info p-4 m-4"></div>
            <div id="err-div6" class="m-4"></div>
            <button type="button" class="btn btn-secondary m-4" onclick="document.getElementById('output6').innerHTML='';
            document.getElementById('err-div6').innerHTML='';">
                Clear Output
            </button>
            <p>
                There we should have a very straightforward line plot of 
                the mean temperature.</p>
            </p>
            <p>
                And creating mulitple plots in the same figure is just a matter of creating new axes for
                those plots. (Note that the block of code below relies on the previous one
                so make sure that you have run this first.)
            </p>
            
            <py-repl id="my-repl" std-out="output7" std-err="err-div7">

ax = weather.plot.line(x='Month', y = 'Tmax', color = 'lightgrey', ax=ax)
ax = weather.plot.line(x='Month', y = 'Tmin', color = 'lightgrey', ax=ax)
fig
            </py-repl>
            <div id="output7" class="border border-info p-4 m-4"></div>
            <div id="err-div7" class="m-4"></div>
            <button type="button" class="btn btn-secondary m-4" onclick="document.getElementById('output7').innerHTML='';
            document.getElementById('err-div7').innerHTML='';">
                Clear Output
            </button>

            <p>The code above adds two more axes for the minimum and maximum temperatures - which I've
                coloured differently to the <em>mean</em> plot - and then replots the figure.</p>

            </p>
            <p>You can see that this gives us a range that could be more visually appealing if it were
                shaded.</p>
            <p>We do this using the Matplotlib function <code>fill_between()</code> as follows:</p>
            <p>```` Python
                plt.fill_between(weather['Month'],
                weather['Tmax'],
                weather['Tmin'], color='lightgrey', alpha=0.5)</p>
            <p>ax.get_legend().set_visible(False)
                ax.set_ylabel('Temperature Range Â°C')
                ````</p>
            <p>The fill colour is set to <code>lightgrey</code> so it blends in the the upper and lower
                plots. I've also hidded the legend and given the y axis a label to show what we are
                attempting to represent.</p>
            <p><img width="25%" alt="" src="https://github.com/alanjones2/12Visuals/raw/main/images/lineplotshaded.png">
            </p>
            <p>As you can see this would be a very suitable representation of a confidence levels. You
                could, for example, create the upper and lower plots using a fixed percentage of the
                original one. So, for example, the upper plot line could take the value of the centre
                value plus 5%, and the lower one the centre value minus 5%.</p>
