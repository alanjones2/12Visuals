<h2>5. Line</h2>

<p>Line graphs are used for continuous data and, often, for time series data, too.</p>
<p>Using the same weather data as above, we are going to look at three different line graphs.</p>
<p>
    First, we'll plot the mean temperature over the year, then we'll see how we can place
    multiple plots in the same figure by plotting mean, maximum and minimum temperatures.
    Finally, in the third chart we will see how we can show a range of values by plotting
    the mean temperature with shading around it to indicate the range of maximum and minimum
    around that mean - you can use the same technique to show confidence levels.
</p>
<p>
    First we read in the data. It contains various monthly readings for temperature, hours of
    sunshine and rainfall.
</p>

<p>Now, the simple line plot.</p>

<py-repl id="line1" output="line1-output" stderr="line1-output">
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

weather = pd.read_csv('./london2018-2.csv')

fig, ax = plt.subplots()
ax = weather.plot.line(x='Month', y = 'Tmean', ax=ax)
fig
</py-repl>


<div id="line1-output" class="border p-4"></div>
<div id="line1-output"></div>
<button type="button" class="btn btn-secondary m-4" onclick="document.getElementById('line1-output').innerHTML='';
            document.getElementById('line1-output').innerHTML='';">
    Clear Output
</button>

<p>
    There we should have a very straightforward line plot of
    the mean temperature.</p>
</p>
<p>
    And creating multiple plots in the same figure is just a matter of creating new axes for
    those plots. (Note that the block of code below relies on the previous one
    so make sure that you have run this first.)
</p>


<py-repl id="line2" output="line2-output" stderr="line2-output">
    ax = weather.plot.line(x='Month', y = 'Tmax', color = 'lightgrey', ax=ax)
    ax = weather.plot.line(x='Month', y = 'Tmin', color = 'lightgrey', ax=ax)
    fig
</py-repl>

<div id="line2-output" class="border p-4"></div>
<button type="button" class="btn btn-secondary m-4" onclick="document.getElementById('line2-output').innerHTML='';
                    document.getElementById('line2-output').innerHTML='';">
    Clear Output
</button>


<p>
    The code above adds two more axes for the minimum and maximum temperatures - which I've
    coloured differently to the <em>mean</em> plot - and then replots the figure.</p>
<p>
    You can see that this shows us the range of temperatures but we can do better than that.
    It would be clearer if the range were shaded.
    <!-- as in the figure.
            <img width="50%" alt="" src="https://github.com/alanjones2/12Visuals/raw/main/images/lineplotshaded.png">-->
</p>

<p>
    We can achieve this using the Matplotlib function <code>fill_between()</code> as in following code.
    (Again, you should make sure you have run the two previous
    code blocks before running this one.)
</p>

<py-repl id="line3" output="line3-output" std-err="line3-output">
plt.fill_between(weather['Month'],
weather['Tmax'],
weather['Tmin'],
color='lightgrey')

ax.get_legend().set_visible(False)
ax.set_ylabel('Temperature Range Â°C')

fig
</py-repl>

<div id="line3-output" class="border p-4"></div>
<button type="button" class="btn btn-secondary m-4" onclick="document.getElementById('line3-output').innerHTML='';
                    document.getElementById('line3-output').innerHTML='';">
    Clear Output
</button>


<p>
    The fill colour is set to <code>lightgrey</code> so it blends in the the upper and lower
    plots. Also the legend is hidden because the top and bottom plots are no longer visible.
    Instead of the legend, the y axis has a label to show what it is that we are
    trying to represent.
</p>
<p>
    As you can see this would be a very suitable representation of confidence levels. You
    could, for example, create the upper and lower plots using a fixed percentage of the
    original one. So the upper plot line could take the value of the centre
    value plus 5%, and the lower one the centre value minus 5%.
    For example:
</p>


<py-repl id="line4" output="line4-output" stderr="line4-output">
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import pandas as pd

df2 = pd.DataFrame({'col':[0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10]})

fig2, ax2 = plt.subplots()
df2.plot.line(ax=ax2)

plt.fill_between(df2.index,
df2['col']*1.05,
df2['col']*0.95,
color='lightblue')

ax2.set_ylabel('Values with 5% confidence levels')

fig2
</py-repl>

<div id="line4-output" class="border p-4"></div>
<button type="button" class="btn btn-secondary m-4" onclick="document.getElementById('line4-output').innerHTML='';
                            document.getElementById('line4-output').innerHTML='';">
    Clear Output
</button>


<p>Try changing the code above to make the confidence levels +/- 10%</p>
