<h2>1. Simple text</h2>

<p>Sometimes, a graphic isn't necessary,
    or even the best option to communicate data. When only a couple values are to be
    presented, simple text is fine and may even be better than a graph. Let's take an
    example.</p>
<p>The weather in London, UK, seems to getting hotter in the Summer. The maximum temperature in
    July 2022 was 27.2 degrees Celsius, which is quite hot for the UK. In 2012 it was 24.2
    degrees.</p>

<p>Now, look at the bar graph - it shows a temperature change from one year to another.
    And while it's clear that the temperature went up a few degrees, you can't clearly see
    exactly how much or precisely what those temperatures are.</p>

</p>

<p>So, let's see how some text only visuals can give us a better idea of what is going on.</p>

<p> The code below is a Mathplotlib chart but with no figure plotted in it - we simply
    position text in the right places using <code>ax.text()</code>, where the first two parameters are the x/y
    coordinates.
    We turn of the axes, ticks etc. with the statement <code>ax3.axis('off')</code>, so that we end up with just the text.

</p>
<p>
    Run the code below to see the figure that we have created and feel free to change some of the
    code to achieve a different effect (maybe the font size, colors or x/y coordinates).
    (Remember, to run the code click the green play button at
    the bottom right.)

        alignment or colours, perhaps.
