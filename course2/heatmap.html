            <h2>3. Heatmaps</h2>
            <p>
                A heatmap is a figure that uses colour rather than numbers to highlight value differences in
                a table.

                The figure below shows the relative global temperatures over the last 150 years or so and is
                taken from my article 
                <a href="https://towardsdatascience.com/topical-plots-global-warming-6b5fb80a0371">
                    Topical Plots: Global Warming Heatmaps
                </a>.
            </p>

            <p>
                One of the easiest ways of creating a heatmap is with the Seaborn library. You can see from
                the code below that Seaborn simply take a Pandas dataframe as a parameter and displays
                the appropiate map as a Matplotlib chart.

                Run the code to see the heatmap.
            </p>

            <py-script>
                utils.codeElement("heatmap1", codefile="./code/heatmap1.py")
            </py-script>
            <div id="heatmap1"></div>
            

            <p>You can achieve a similar chart using the <code>imshow()</code> function in Matplotlib.</p>
