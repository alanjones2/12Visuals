<h2>4. Scatterplot</h2>

<p>
    Scatterplots are used to show the relationship between two variables. The example below uses
    a data file that records weather data for each month in London in 2018. This data set records
    the maximum, minimum and mean temperatures (<i>Tmax</i>, <i>Tmin</i> and <i>Tmean</i>), the rainfall (<i>Rain</i>)
    and the number of hours of sunshine (<i>Sun</i>) for each month.
</p>
<p>
    We'll create a scatter plot that
    plots the level of rainfall in millimetres, against the number of hours of sunshine.
    Of course, when it is raining the sun is not normally shining, so you would expect to see
    fewer hours of sunshine when it rains more. You will notice that the scatter diagram clearly shows this
    relationship.</p>
<p>The code below uses the Matplotlib to create the chart.</p>
</div>

<p>The data looks something like this:

</p>

<py-repl id="scatter1" output="scatter1-output" stderr="scatter1-output">

import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

weather = pd.read_csv('./london2018-2.csv')
fig, ax = plt.subplots()
weather.plot.scatter(x='Rain', y='Sun', ax=ax)
fig

</py-repl>

<div id="scatter1-output" class="border p-4"></div>

<button type="button" class="btn btn-secondary m-4" onclick="document.getElementById('scatter1-output').innerHTML='';
                        document.getElementById('scatter1-output').innerHTML='';">
    Clear Output
</button>
<p>
    When you have run this code, clear the output and try changing the <code>y</code> parameter to 'Tmean' -
    that
    will plot rainfall against the mean temperature <code>Tmean</code>. Run it again and you will see that, as
    you might expect,
    the temperature tends to be higher when it is not raining. (If you don't <i>Clear Output</i>)
    before running the code again, the new plot will be appended to the old one.)
