            <h2>6. Slopegraph</h2>
            <p>A Slopegraph is simply a line graph that conforms a particular style but that only compares
                two sets of values.</p>
            <p>According to CNK, "slopegraphs can be useful when you have two time periods or points of
                comparison and want to quickly show relative increases
                and decreases".</p>
            <p>Unfortunately, the slopegraph is not often found in standard visualization libraries, so you
                could simply use a line graph instead and it should convey the same meaning.</p>
            <p>I'll carry on with our weather theme, I'm going to create a couple of graphs that display the
                change in temperature that we saw in the text figure, above, but this time we compare
                London to Wick, in Scotland:</p>

            </p>
            <p>This data represents the maximum temperature is two cities in two seperate years. In the
                following code we draw two plots in the same figure. The first is a simple line graph of
                the data, then we superimpose a scatter chart with only four points to give us the
                archetypal blobs at the end of the slopegraph lines.</p>
            <p>```` Python
                import streamlit as st
                import pandas as pd
                import matplotlib.pyplot as plt</p>
            <p>st.header("Slope graph")</p>
            <p>st.subheader("Here is the data")
                df = pd.DataFrame()
                df['year']=[2012,2022]
                df['London']=(24.2,27.2)
                df['Wick']=(14.8,17.3)</p>
            <p>st.table(df)</p>
            <p>st.subheader("A Slopegraph as a line graph")
                fig, ax = plt.subplots()</p>
            <p>ax = df.plot(x='year', color = ('red', 'blue'), ax=ax)
                ax = df.plot.scatter(x='year',y='London', color= 'red', ax=ax)
                df.plot.scatter(x='year',y='Wick', color = 'blue', ax=ax)</p>
            <p>plt.xlim(2010,2024)
                plt.xticks(df['year'])
                ax.set_ylabel('')
                st.pyplot(fig)
                ````
                It looks reasonably ok but is not the typical form of a slopechart, certainly not the
                way they are represented in the CNK's book.</p>
            <p><img width="25%" alt="" src="https://github.com/alanjones2/12Visuals/raw/main/images/slopeline.png"></p>
            <p>To make a more conventional slopegraph we need to do a bit of manipulation on the matplotlib
                graph.</p>
            <p>Here's the type of rendering that CNK has in her book:</p>
            <p><img width="25%" alt="" src="https://github.com/alanjones2/12Visuals/raw/main/images/slope.png"></p>
            <p>It's quite different in that the y values, and the legend text, are written at the ends of
                the lines and the conventional axes are removed.</p>
            <p>Running this code will display the graph above.</p>
            <p>```` Python
                ax.text(df.year[0] -5, df.London[0], df.columns[1])
                ax.text(df.year[0] -2.5,df.London[0], f'{df.London[0]}째C')
                ax.text(df.year[1] +1, df.London[1],f'{df.London[1]}째C')
                ax.text(df.year[0] -5, df.Wick[0], df.columns[2])
                ax.text(df.year[0] -2.5, df.Wick[0],f'{df.Wick[0]}째C')
                ax.text(df.year[1] +1, df.Wick[1],f'{df.Wick[1]}째C')</p>
            <p>ax.spines['right'].set_visible(False)
                ax.spines['left'].set_visible(False)
                ax.spines['bottom'].set_visible(False)
                ax.spines['top'].set_visible(False)</p>
            <p>ax.xaxis.grid(visible=True, color = 'black')
                ax.get_yaxis().set_visible(False)</p>
            <p>ax.get_legend().set_visible(False)</p>
            <p>st.pyplot(fig)
                ````
                The first six lines add the text and values to the endo of the lines, then we remove the
                splines (the frame of the chart) and finally we add an x-axis grid (which only consists
                of two lines) and hide the legend.</p>
            <p>Is that too much effort for a not much different result? I'll let you decide.</p>
